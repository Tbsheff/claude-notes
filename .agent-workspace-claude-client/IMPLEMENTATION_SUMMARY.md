# ClaudeClient Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

I've successfully created a centralized `ClaudeClient` class that handles both OAuth Bearer tokens and API key authentication seamlessly. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. ClaudeClient Class (`/lib/llm/claude-client.ts`)

A robust HTTP client with the following features:

- **Automatic Authentication Detection**: Prefers OAuth tokens when available and valid, falls back to API key
- **Bearer Token Support**: Properly formats `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers for OAuth
- **API Key Support**: Uses `x-api-key` header for traditional authentication
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: On 401 errors, attempts to refresh OAuth tokens and retry the request
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff for rate limiting
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all API requests and responses
- **Streaming Support**: Includes async generator for streaming responses

### 2. Updated Core Implementation (`/lib/llm/core-new.ts`)

- Modified to use ClaudeClient instead of direct fetch calls
- Maintains singleton client instance for efficiency
- Automatically syncs with auth service for OAuth tokens
- Provides helper functions for auth status checking

### 3. Updated AI Service (`/electron/services/ai-service-new.ts`)

- Integrated ClaudeClient for all API calls
- Manages OAuth token persistence on refresh
- Supports both auth methods in AI agent initialization

### 4. Updated Agent Library (`/lib/agent/index-new.ts`)

- Custom Anthropic provider that supports Bearer token authentication
- Dynamic provider switching based on available auth method
- Maintains compatibility with existing streaming API

## Key Features

### Authentication Flow
```
1. Check for OAuth tokens → Use Bearer authentication
2. No OAuth or expired → Check for API key → Use x-api-key
3. No auth available → Throw clear error
```

### Token Refresh Flow
```
1. Receive 401 error with OAuth
2. Check if refresh token available
3. Call refresh endpoint
4. Update stored tokens
5. Retry original request with new token
6. If refresh fails, throw error
```

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Initialize client
const client = new ClaudeClient({
  apiKey: 'sk-ant-...',
  oauthTokens: { access_token: '...', refresh_token: '...' },
  onTokenRefresh: async (tokens) => {
    // Persist new tokens
    await authService.storeTokens(tokens)
  }
})

// Make API call
const response = await client.createMessage({
  model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
  max_tokens: 1000
})
```

## Migration Path

The implementation is ready to be integrated. The migration involves:

1. Copy the new files to replace existing implementations
2. Test OAuth flow with token refresh
3. Test API key fallback
4. Verify all existing functionality works

All new files are located in `/root/repo/.agent-workspace-claude-client/` and are ready to be moved to their final locations.
