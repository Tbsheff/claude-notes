# Migration Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive config schema migration system to move API keys from database storage to the OS keychain for improved security. The system is designed to be safe, reversible, and handles edge cases gracefully.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Settings Service (`electron/services/settings-service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages application settings with schema versioning
- **Key Features**:
  - Schema version tracking (current version: 2)
  - Settings persistence to disk with atomic writes
  - Migration history tracking
  - Sensitive data clearing capabilities
  - Import/export functionality (excludes sensitive data)
  - Debounced saves to prevent excessive disk writes

### 2. Migration Service (`electron/services/migration-service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates schema migrations from v1 to v2
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic detection of needed migrations
  - Progress tracking with event emissions
  - Rollback mechanism on failure
  - Health check and repair functionality
  - Force migration capability for testing
  - Detailed logging and error handling

### 3. Updated Auth Service (`auth-service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced to support separate API key storage
- **New Methods**:
  - `storeApiKey()`: Store migrated API keys separately
  - `getApiKey()`: Retrieve API keys from keychain
  - `clearApiKey()`: Remove API keys from keychain
  - `hasAuthentication()`: Check for any auth (OAuth or API key)

### 4. IPC Handlers
- **Settings Handlers** (`electron/ipc/settings-handlers.ts`):
  - Initialize, get, set, reset settings
  - Import/export functionality
  - Filters sensitive data from renderer access

- **Migration Handlers** (`electron/ipc/migration-handlers.ts`):
  - Check migration status
  - Run migrations manually
  - Force migration (testing)
  - Check and repair
  - Rollback capability
  - Real-time status updates via subscriptions

### 5. Main Process Integration (`electron.ts`)
- **Enhanced with**:
  - Automatic migration on startup
  - Service initialization
  - Error dialogs for migration failures
  - Health checks after migration

### 6. Documentation
- **Migration Documentation** (`docs/MIGRATION_DOCUMENTATION.md`):
  - Comprehensive guide for the migration system
  - Architecture overview
  - Error handling procedures
  - Testing guidelines
  - Troubleshooting steps

### 7. Tests (`electron/services/__tests__/migration-service.test.ts`)
- Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Migration success scenarios
  - Failure handling
  - Rollback functionality
  - Health checks
  - Concurrent migration prevention

### 8. UI Component (`renderer/components/MigrationStatus.tsx`)
- React component for migration UI
- Real-time progress tracking
- Error display
- Manual migration triggers
- Check and repair functionality

## Migration Flow

### Automatic Migration (On Startup)
1. App starts → Settings service initializes
2. Migration service checks if current schema < 2
3. If migration needed:
   - Read API key from settings.json
   - Store in OS keychain using auth service
   - Verify successful storage
   - Clear API key from settings.json
   - Update schema version to 2
   - Record migration in history

### Manual Migration (Via IPC)
- Users can trigger migration from settings UI
- Force migration available for testing
- Check and repair for fixing issues

## Security Features

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - Never exposed to renderer process
   - Stored encrypted in OS keychain
   - Cleared from memory after migration

2. **Rollback Safety**:
   - API keys can be restored from keychain to settings
   - Schema version reverted on failure
   - Migration history preserved

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Keychain access failures handled gracefully
   - User prompted for permissions if needed
   - Detailed error logging for debugging

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No API Key Present**: Migration skips gracefully
2. **Keychain Access Denied**: User notified, can retry
3. **Partial Migration**: Automatic rollback attempted
4. **Corrupted Settings**: Repair function attempts recovery
5. **Concurrent Migrations**: Prevented with locks

## Testing the Implementation

### To Test Fresh Installation:
```bash
# Remove existing settings
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/claude-notes/settings.json
# Start app - should create v2 settings
```

### To Test Migration:
```bash
# Create v1 settings with API key
echo '{"schemaVersion":1,"apiKey":"test-key-123"}' > ~/Library/Application\ Support/claude-notes/settings.json
# Start app - should migrate automatically
```

### To Test Failed Migration:
1. Deny keychain access when prompted
2. App should show error dialog
3. Can retry from settings UI

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extensible:
- Add new migrations by incrementing `TARGET_SCHEMA_VERSION`
- Implement new migration methods following the v1→v2 pattern
- All migrations are reversible with proper rollback logic

## Summary

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly way to migrate sensitive data from file storage to the OS keychain. The system handles all edge cases gracefully and provides comprehensive monitoring and recovery options.
